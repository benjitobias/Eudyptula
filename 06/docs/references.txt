Make and install man pages

yes, there is 9th section of man pages. If you have no files in man/man9/ directories,
you have to build it from linux source.
So download source and build man pages with command: "make mandocs",
then install them with command: "make installmandocs" to /usr/local/man/man9/
There are many others targets, for list see "make help".
