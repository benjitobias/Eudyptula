I forgot to run checkpatch.pl and I also submitted the code instaed of a patch.

I sent the files (without the patch - they didn't want the patch) and had mistakes still.

I played a bit with the checkpatch.pl script and fealies that I can pass a -f argument and give it a file instead of the patch which helped me find the errors easier.
